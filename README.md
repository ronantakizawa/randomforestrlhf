# Random Forest Image Classification Model for Racial Detection with RLHF

  Models like racial classification are heavily biased based on the initial labeling of the dataset. With a lack of diverse cultural representation in ML academia, many datasets are biased.By adding RLHF to a classification model a model can include human bias to combat the initial bias in a dataset.

  This random forest image classification model detects if a person is black or not based on their face. The model is first built by the given data and labels, and then tuned using RLHF via prompts to the user on the CLI. 

  In the context of Critical Race Theory, "Black" is understood as a socially constructed category that goes beyond mere biological or phenotypical attributes. Therefore, categorizing someone as "Black" varies depending on a person's cultural background. In theory, by giving this model to a variety of people to give feedback, the model will tune itself to capture the definition of "Blackness" that an initially biased model and dataset couldn't capture.
